# Pre-requisites for Productive Political Discourse

Rules for productive discussion: how to find truth while remaining civil and avoid tribalism / groupthink

1) Go into the conversation realizing either of us can be wrong

2) Accept that you probably have a bias, and go into conversation actively looking for it

3) Being right / wrong doesn't matter, all that matters is figuring out the truth

4) "Weighing balance" mentality instead of "My side vs your side"

5) Nuanced perspectives are valid and encouraged. You can agree with one component of an argument, and disagree with another. Agreeing with one component does not imply total agreement of a side. Separate logical arguments should be recognized as separate.

6) **All discussion should be strictly be about premises and reasoning.** Views themselves should not be pre-determined or challenged. Views should be a function of premise and reasoning. If the premise changes, or better reasoning is found, view should update accordingly. E.g: 

```
reasoning_function(premise) -> view
```

7) **Attempt to understand the intention behinds someones statement**, instead of trying to pedantically pick apart specific wording of a statement

## Optional
