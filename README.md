## 1. Go into the conversation realizing either of us can be wrong

## 2. Accept that you probably have a bias, and go into conversation actively looking for it

## 3. Being right / wrong doesn't matter, all that matters is figuring out the truth

## 4. "Weighing balance" mentality instead of "My team vs your team"

## 5. Nuanced perspectives are valid and encouraged
You can agree with one component of an argument, and disagree with another. Agreeing with one component does not imply total agreement of a side. Separate logical arguments should be recognized as separate.

## 6. All discussion should strictly be about premises and reasoning
Views themselves should not be pre-determined or challenged. Views should be a function of premise and reasoning. If the premise changes, or better reasoning is found, view should update accordingly. E.g: 

```
reasoning_function(premise) -> view
```

## 7. Attempt to understand the intention behind someone's statement
Instead of trying to pedantically pick apart specific wording of a statement

## [Optional] 8. ~~No alcohol~~ Less alcohol the better
