## 1. Both parties should accept the possibility of being wrong
If you were wrong, would you want to know? If the answer is no, then no point in discussing.

## 2. Discussion should be about premises (facts) and reasoning, rather than views directly
Views themselves should not be pre-determined or challenged. Views should be a **function** of **premises** and **reasoning**. If a premise changes, or better reasoning is found, your view should update accordingly. E.g: 

```
# GOOD

reasoning_function(premise) -> view
```
Note: The opposite of this is **confirmation bias**, illustrated as:
```
# BAD

find_facts_to_backup_view(view) -> premise
```

## 3. Accept that you probably have a bias, and go into conversation actively looking for it

Signs you may have bias:
- If you find yourself constantly trying to "make one side work" in your head (see #2 about confirmation bias)
- If your reason/premise for a view is "Everyone knows" or "It just is" instead of hard fact (see #2)
- If presented with evidence against an existing view, you refuse to accept this new view as a possibility (this violates #1)

## 4. Nuanced perspectives are valid and encouraged

Things are generally not black and white, there are usually gradations. Avoid the hyper-partisan trap of modern politics.

- You can agree with one component of an argument, and disagree with another. 
- Agreeing with one component of a side does not imply total agreement of a side. 
- Separate logical arguments should be recognized as separate.

## 5. Attempt to understand the intention behind someone's statement
Rather than pedantically pick apart specific wording of a statement

## 6. "Weighing balance" mentality instead of "My team vs your team"
This is science, not football.

## 7. Being right / wrong doesn't matter, only figuring out the truth
Again, this is discovery, not competition.
