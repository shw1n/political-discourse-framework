## 1. Go into the conversation realizing either of us can be wrong
If either party refuses this possibility, no point in going any further.

## 2. Accept that you probably have a bias, and go into conversation actively looking for it
It exists!

## 4. "Weighing balance" mentality instead of "My team vs your team"
This is science, not football.

## 3. Being right / wrong doesn't matter, only figuring out the truth
Again, this is discovery, not competition.

## 5. Nuanced perspectives are valid and encouraged
- You can agree with one component of an argument, and disagree with another. 
- Agreeing with one component of a side does not imply total agreement of a side. 
- Separate logical arguments should be recognized as separate.

## 6. All discussion should strictly be about premises and reasoning
Views themselves should not be pre-determined or challenged. Views should be a **function** of **premises** and **reasoning**. If a premise changes, or better reasoning is found, your view should update accordingly. E.g: 

```
# GOOD

reasoning_function(premise) -> view
```
Note: The opposite of this is **confirmation bias**, illustrated as:
```
# BAD

find_facts_to_backup_view(view) -> premise
```

## 7. Attempt to understand the intention behind someone's statement
Rather than pedantically pick apart specific wording of a statement

## 8. \[Optional] ~~No alcohol~~ Less alcohol the better
This rule found empirically through *extensive research*.
